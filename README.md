# mosaic-image-reproduction
Project in the course TNM097, Link√∂ping University, 2018.

Reproduction of arbitrary image using random 20x20 images in a database. The input image is divided into a 20x20 meshgrid, where each grid is compared to the database images. The database image with closest distance in CIELAB color space and structural similarity, given certain weights, replaces the grid.
